‚ùì Because CST has smaller movements, does neural variance also decrease as much as you would expect? üìä Analysis: compare total neural variance between CO and CST ‚úîÔ∏è CST usually has smaller variance than CO, but unclear yet if it&amp;rsquo;s what we would expect from smaller movements ‚ùì Remiaining question: is this variance solely due to smaller movements?</description></item></channel></rss>
