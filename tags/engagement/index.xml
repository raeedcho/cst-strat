Perhaps something that corresponds to whether $\lambda$ changed on the last trial, or whether there have been previous failures?
In Hennig et al. 2021, they found a neural dimension corresponding to engagement with the BCI task. When there were changes in the task (e.g. the decoder changes), activity along this axis increases and then slowly decreases over a series of trials.</description></item></channel></rss>
