Does this show up as M1 dynamics being less apparently autonomous? That is, is neural tangling higher in CST than CO? ‚úîÔ∏è Tangling doesn&amp;rsquo;t really appear to be much higher in CST than CO, suggesting that the feedback may be &amp;ldquo;predictable&amp;rdquo; most of the time. üí¨ Does tangling depend on the amount of data you use to check it?</description></item><item><title>CO Condition independent signal analysis</title><link>https://raeedcho.github.io/cst-strat/log/2021/12/cis-analysis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raeedcho.github.io/cst-strat/log/2021/12/cis-analysis/</guid><description>‚ùì Is there a neural &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; signal underlying intermittent movements/control?
One result out of the literature recently has been that there are condition-independent signals (CIS) in neural activity that don&amp;rsquo;t relate to the exact movement being performed, but rather as a signal of whether a movement is being performed at all (see Kaufman et al. 2016, Rouse et al. 2018, Zimnik and Churchland 2021). The signal seems like a kind of neural &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; signal&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s one thing we might be able to look for in CST as a marker of corrective or intermittent movements.</description></item></channel></rss>
