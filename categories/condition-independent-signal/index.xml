One result out of the literature recently has been that there are condition-independent signals (CIS) in neural activity that don&amp;rsquo;t relate to the exact movement being performed, but rather as a signal of whether a movement is being performed at all (see Kaufman et al. 2016, Rouse et al. 2018, Zimnik and Churchland 2021). The signal seems like a kind of neural &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; signal&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s one thing we might be able to look for in CST as a marker of corrective or intermittent movements.</description></item></channel></rss>
