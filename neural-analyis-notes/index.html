<li>❓ How does average firing rate change across tasks?
<ul>
<li>📊 Analysis: compare averages across tasks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>❓ How does average firing rate change between hold and movement, within and across tasks?

</li>
<li>Tuning curves
<ul>
<li>❓ How similar is single neural tuning between CO and CST?
<ul>
<li>📊 Analysis: Compare left/right selectivity between CO and CST
<ul>
<li>✔️ Note: This is basically the sensorimotor index analysis, which showed similar tuning between the tasks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>📊 Analysis: Fit GLMs and examine how parameters shift between CO and CST
<ul>
<li>❗ Note/caution: neural GLMs are usually noisy and tricky to glean interpretation from</li>

Population analyses
<a class=anchor href=#population-analyses>#</a>
</h2>
<p>List of population analysis methods we could use to compare CO and CST</p>
<ul>
<li>Neural covariance
<ul>
<li>❓ Because CST has smaller movements, does neural variance also decrease as much as you would expect?
<ul>
<li>📊 Analysis: compare total neural variance between CO and CST</li>
<li>✔️ CST usually has smaller variance than CO, but unclear yet if it&rsquo;s what we would expect from smaller movements</li>
<li>❓ Remiaining question: is this variance solely due to smaller movements? Not sure how to address this question though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>❓ CST seems like a more complex task than CO&ndash;does this mean that neural activity explores more dimensions?
<ul>
<li>📊 compare CO and CST covariance rank (i.e. dimensionality)
<ul>
<li>✔️ CST does not seem to have much higher dimensionality, but activity is much closer to noise floor</li>
<li>💬 Three methods of dimensionality estimation (participation ratio, parallel analysis, and GPFA cross-validated log-likelihood) give differing results</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>❓ How much do CST and CO overlap in the neural manifold?
<ul>
<li>📊 compare neural covariance dimensions between CO and CST, using subspace overlap or principle angles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subspace analysis
<ul>
<li>❓ Is there a neural &ldquo;go&rdquo; signal underlying intermittent movements/control?
<ul>
<li>📊 Condition independent signal analysis
<ul>
<li>💬 It&rsquo;s difficult to pull out a meaningful CIS at a single trial level, even for CO task. We probably need a method for trial-averaging CST to make use of this (like submovement decomposition)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>❓ is there a dimension of neural activity corresponding to neural engagement? Perhaps something that corresponds to whether $\lambda$ changed on the last trial, or whether there have been previous failures?
<ul>
<li>📊 Analyze major neural dimensions during hold period after failures and $\lambda$ changes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>📊 Behaviorally potent/null space analysis
<ul>
<li>❓ Do CO and CST share a kinematic potent space? (use principle angles and subspace alignment)
<ul>
<li>✔️ Sudarshan&rsquo;s and my own analysis suggests that potent spaces are at least partially aligned</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>❓ How much neural variance lies in the potent and null spaces of each task, compared to total neural variance?</li>
<li>❓ Is there any correspondence between the timing of null space activation and movement?
<ul>
<li>💬 Note: our arrays don&rsquo;t seem to have preparatory activity, which is what you&rsquo;d expect to find in the null space. But there may be some information about visual feedback, if we can isolate feedback integration times</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>❓ What does the null space activity look like during BCI CST, where potent space is specified?
<ul>
<li>💬 Aaron says that BCI data might not be great? Need to check with Emily</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>❓ Are there dimensions of neural activity that separate CO and CST?
<ul>
<li>✔️ Hold time analysis says possibly in the very early part of the movement, but perhaps this is due to kinematic differences?</li>
<li>❓ if there&rsquo;s a task context dimension, how aligned with kinematic potent space is it? Perhaps this dimension separates different motor cortical dynamic regimes?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neural dynamics
<ul>
<li>📊 Tangling analysis
<ul>
<li>❓ CST is much more feedback driven than CO. Does this show up as M1 dynamics being less apparently autonomous? That is, is neural tangling higher in CST than CO?
<ul>
<li>✔️ Tangling doesn&rsquo;t really appear to be much higher in CST than CO, suggesting that the feedback may be &ldquo;predictable&rdquo; most of the time.</li>
<li>💬 Does tangling depend on the amount of data you use to check it? Right now I&rsquo;m thinking it probably does, but I can&rsquo;t be sure without simulation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>❓ Does the timecourse of tangling over a CST or CO trial reveal anything about corrective movements? Perhaps tangling increases before corrective movements or after apparent errors to signify introduction of unexpected feedback.
<ul>
<li>💬 May need to develop corrective movement detection to enable trial averaging, as well as apparent error detection (for CST, this might equate to moving the hand in the wrong direction)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>📊 Neural dynamic modeling
<ul>
<li>❓ Does CST contain different neural dynamical regimes? e.g. movement vs. hold/preparation
<ul>
<li>❗ CO seems to have different regimes, according to previous work, but CST data seems a bit too noisy as is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>❓ Does CST have autonomous and input-driven times in neural dynamics? That is, if we infer inputs to a neural dynamical system (AutoLFADS), do the inputs look similar between movement initiation and submovements?
<ul>
<li>💬 Other work suggests movement initiation and corrective movements share features like condition independent signal and inferred inputs</li>
</ul>
