Does this show up as M1 dynamics being less apparently autonomous? That is, is neural tangling higher in CST than CO? ‚úîÔ∏è Tangling doesn&amp;rsquo;t really appear to be much higher in CST than CO, suggesting that the feedback may be &amp;ldquo;predictable&amp;rdquo; most of the time. üí¨ Does tangling depend on the amount of data you use to check it?</description></item><item><title>CO-CST hold time analysis</title><link>https://raeedcho.github.io/cst-strat/log/2021/12/hold-analysis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raeedcho.github.io/cst-strat/log/2021/12/hold-analysis/</guid><description>‚ùì Are there dimensions of neural activity that separate CO and CST? ‚úîÔ∏è Hold time analysis says possibly in the very early part of the movement, but perhaps this is due to kinematic differences? Gallego et al. 2018 showed that M1 neural activity underlying multiple tasks shared some dimensions of neural activity, but also that there were certain dimensions of activity that separated different tasks. Though the tasks differed in the impedance of wrist movement (ranging from isometric to freely moving), the tasks were quite comparable: they were all wrist-based tasks with similar trial structure, where the monkey moved a cursor to visually presented targets within a set amount of time.</description></item><item><title>CST neural engagement analysis</title><link>https://raeedcho.github.io/cst-strat/log/2021/12/engagement-analysis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raeedcho.github.io/cst-strat/log/2021/12/engagement-analysis/</guid><description>‚ùì Is there a dimension of neural activity corresponding to neural engagement? Perhaps something that corresponds to whether $\lambda$ changed on the last trial, or whether there have been previous failures?
In Hennig et al. 2021, they found a neural dimension corresponding to engagement with the BCI task. When there were changes in the task (e.g. the decoder changes), activity along this axis increases and then slowly decreases over a series of trials.</description></item><item><title>CO Condition independent signal analysis</title><link>https://raeedcho.github.io/cst-strat/log/2021/12/cis-analysis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raeedcho.github.io/cst-strat/log/2021/12/cis-analysis/</guid><description>‚ùì Is there a neural &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; signal underlying intermittent movements/control?
One result out of the literature recently has been that there are condition-independent signals (CIS) in neural activity that don&amp;rsquo;t relate to the exact movement being performed, but rather as a signal of whether a movement is being performed at all (see Kaufman et al. 2016, Rouse et al. 2018, Zimnik and Churchland 2021). The signal seems like a kind of neural &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; signal&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s one thing we might be able to look for in CST as a marker of corrective or intermittent movements.</description></item><item><title>CO-CST covariance analysis</title><link>https://raeedcho.github.io/cst-strat/log/2021/12/covariance-analysis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://raeedcho.github.io/cst-strat/log/2021/12/covariance-analysis/</guid><description>For neural covariance analysis, we have a number of possible questions:
‚ùì Because CST has smaller movements, does neural variance also decrease as much as you would expect? üìä Analysis: compare total neural variance between CO and CST ‚úîÔ∏è CST usually has smaller variance than CO, but unclear yet if it&amp;rsquo;s what we would expect from smaller movements ‚ùì Remiaining question: is this variance solely due to smaller movements?</description></item></channel></rss>
